Executive Summary

This report outlines the exploitation techniques used against Active Directory (AD) environments, focusing on Kerberoasting, NTDS.dit Extraction, and Pass-the-Hash (PTH) attacks, The goal is to simulate real-world attacks performed by advanced threat actors (ATAs) and provide actionable mitigation strategies for defending against these techniques.

The research includes:
- âœ… Real-world attack demonstrations.
- âœ… MITRE ATT&CK TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mapping.
- âœ… Detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) exploitation examples.
- âœ… Defensive strategies and mitigations.

Active Directory Exploitation Techniques

1. Kerberoasting Attack (T1558.003)

Objective: Steal plaintext credentials of Active Directory users by requesting service tickets and cracking their associated NTLM hashes.

TTP:
- Tactic: Credential Access.
- Technique: Kerberoasting (T1558.003).

Attack Flow:
1. Request a service ticket (TGS) from the KDC.
2. Extract the NTLM hash from the ticket.
3. Attempt to crack the hash offline.

PoC Attack:
```powershell
# Request SPNs with vulnerable accounts
GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip [DomainControllerIP] [DOMAIN]/[User]:[Password]

# Crack the hash using Hashcat
hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt rockyou.txt --force
```

Outcome:
If successful, the attacker obtains plaintext credentials for Active Directory service accounts.

Mitigation:
- Enforce strong, complex service account passwords.
- Enable AES encryption on service tickets.
- Regularly rotate service account passwords.

2. NTDS.dit Extraction (T1003)

Objective: Exfiltrate the entire Active Directory user database (NTDS.dit) to gain domain admin access.

TTP:
- Tactic: Credential Dumping.
- Technique: NTDS.dit Extraction (T1003).

Attack Flow:
1. Gain administrative privileges.
2. Dump the NTDS.dit file from the domain controller.
3. Extract all user hashes.

PoC Attack:
```powershell
# Use secretsdump to extract NTDS.dit
secretsdump.py [DOMAIN]/[User]:[Password]@[DomainControllerIP]
```

Outcome:
The attacker gains access to ALL domain user hashes.

Mitigation:
- Use LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution).
- Monitor for suspicious DCSync behavior.
- Implement tiered administration models.

3. Pass-the-Hash (PTH) Attack (T1550)

Objective: Use stolen NTLM hashes to authenticate without cracking passwords.

TTP:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement.
- Technique: Pass-the-Hash (T1550).

Attack Flow:
1. Extract NTLM hashes from memory (via LSASS dump).
2. Use the hash to authenticate without the password.

PoC Attack:
```bash
# Pass-the-Hash using psexec
psexec.py -hashes [NTLM-Hash] [User]@[TargetMachine]
```

Outcome:
The attacker can laterally move across the network without valid passwords.

Mitigation:
- Enforce Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS).
- Implement Windows Defender Credential Guard.
- Regularly audit domain controller event logs.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Technique              | Tactic                    | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kerberoasting (T1558.003) | Credential Access        | Steal service account credentials.                           |
| NTDS.dit Extraction (T1003) | Credential Dumping     | Extract all domain user hashes.                              |
| Pass-the-Hash (T1550) | Lateral Movement          | Use NTLM hashes for remote authentication.                   |

Defensive Recommendations

To reduce the risk of Active Directory exploitation, implement the following security measures:

1. Enforce Least Privilege Access.
2. Deploy LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution).
3. Implement Windows Defender Credential Guard.
4. Monitor for Kerberoasting and DCSync attempts.
5. Conduct regular Active Directory Security Assessments.

---

Conclusion

This report demonstrates how Active Directory environments can be compromised through Kerberoasting, NTDS.dit extraction, and Pass-the-Hash attacks. These techniques are heavily leveraged by advanced threat actors (ATAs) and nation-state attackers.

By adopting the mitigation strategies outlined in this report, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of domain compromise.
